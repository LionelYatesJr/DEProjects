# NLP Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves creating a sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The goal is to analyze and classify the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of text data.

## Steps

### Data Collection

Obtained a dataset with text data labeled with sentiments (positive, negative, neutral). The dataset used includes movie reviews, product reviews, or social media comments.

### Data Preprocessing

Cleaned and preprocessed the text data. This involved removing stop words, punctuation, and performing stemming or lemmatization.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explored the dataset to understand the distribution of sentiments. Visualized word frequencies, sentiment distributions, and other relevant insights.

### Feature Engineering

Converted the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

### Model Building

Chose a machine learning model for sentiment analysis. Common choices include logistic regression, support vector machines, or deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer models (e.g., BERT).

### Model Training

Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Trained the sentiment analysis model using the training data.

### Model Evaluation

Evaluated the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Deployment (Optional)

Deployed the model as a web application or API where users can input text, and the model provides sentiment predictions.

### Documentation

Documented the entire process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, model architecture, and evaluation results.
