# Project 2 Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
Create a sentiment analysis model that can analyze and classify the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of text data. This project involves using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Steps:

1. **Data Collection:**
   Obtain a dataset with text data labeled with sentiments (positive, negative, neutral). Popular datasets include movie reviews, product reviews, or social media comments.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   Clean and preprocess the text data. This may involve removing stop words, punctuation, and performing stemming or lemmatization.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of sentiments. Visualize word frequencies, sentiment distributions, and other relevant insights.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   Convert the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

5. **Model Building:**
