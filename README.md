# Project 1 ETL Process for a CSV File

## Objective
Design and implement an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process for a CSV file. ETL is a fundamental concept in data engineering, involving the extraction of data from a source, transformation of the data, and loading it into a destination.

## Steps to Follow:

1. **Choose a Dataset:**
   Pick a CSV dataset that interests you. It could be related to any domain you are passionate about - finance, sports, weather, etc. Websites like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository offer various datasets.

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   Install the necessary tools and libraries. You might need Python, Jupyter Notebooks, or any other preferred programming language for scripting. Consider using Pandas for data manipulation.

3. **Create a Source Folder:**
   Organize your project by creating a folder for the source data. Download and place the CSV file in this folder.

4. **Define the Data Schema:**
   Examine the CSV file and define the schema for the data. Understand the types of data, missing values, and any necessary data transformations.

5. **Write an Extraction Script:**
   Write a script to extract data from the CSV file. Use a programming language of your choice, and consider libraries like Pandas to read the CSV file.

6. **Data Transformation:**
   Implement data transformations based on your defined schema. This might involve cleaning data, handling missing values, or converting data types.

7. **Destination Setup:**
   Choose a destination for your transformed data. It could be a different CSV file, a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL), or a cloud-based storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).

8. **Write a Loading Script:**
   Write a script to load the transformed data into the chosen destination. Ensure that the data is loaded accurately according to your schema.

9. **Automation (Optional):**
   Consider automating your ETL process. You can use scheduling tools like cron jobs or tools like Apache Airflow for more advanced workflow management.
